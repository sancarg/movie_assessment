# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Assessment App

This is a Streamlit app for the TMDB 3000+ Movie Dataset to examine which movie genre has performed best at the box office over the years.

To answer this question, various data preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset to ensure its quality and usability for analysis. You can find these steps in the **Cleaning_TMDB_3000+_movie.ipynb** notebook.

This Streamlit app shows a simple demonstration of an interactive data explorer that allow users to adjust genre type and period of years.

After adjusting the parameters, you will see a plot showing the movie revenue.
